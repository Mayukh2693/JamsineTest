## Install dependencies by running

`npm install`

- Now you can write the tests to test the functions `countDocumentsByQuery` and `insertIntoDb` and push it to the same repository.
- Also you need to write tests which will let the developer know where the gaps are in terms of error handling.

## To run tests

`jasmine`

## Test Cases

`Assumption: Initially the DB is empty`

`TC1- Verifies that empty DB returns null count`
`TC2- Verifies non-null value returned when documents are added to DB`
`TC3- Verify the search result based on query`
`TC4- Verify total number of documents present in DB`
`TC5- Verify collections returned based on query`
`TC6- Verify no results are returned for invalid search`
